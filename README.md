**EV Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction**

This project uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of electric vehicle (EV) batteries.
It aims to support predictive maintenance, reduce operational downtime, and optimize battery replacement planning for EV fleets.

**Project Overview**

- Predict how long an EV battery will remain operational based on real-world charging and usage data.
- Compare the performance of multiple models including:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) – for time-series forecasting
  - XGBoost – for feature-based predictions
  - ARIMA – as a statistical baseline model
- Use evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE to select the best-performing model.
